                My name is <b>Linh Pham</b> and I am an IT/DevOps Engineer

                I have worked in both IT and Dev worlds. On the IT side, I have
                designed and managed compute, storage, virtualization, and public
                and private cloud infrastructure. In the past few years, I've moved
                over to the Dev world as a DevOps engineer; where, I build and manage
                CI/CD pipelines for automated application configuration and deployment
                and help teams with adhering to regulatory and process requirements.
            </p>

                The operating systems that I currently work with include Windows,
                Linux (primarily Debian-based distributions), macOS and FreeBSD.
                I have also managed and developed applicatons for Solaris and AIX.

                When I do have a chance to do some development, Python is my
                language of choice. I have also developed and maintained code
                written in C# and PHP. Swift and Go are on my list of languages
                that I would love to learn.
